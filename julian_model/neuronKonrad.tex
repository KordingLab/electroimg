\title{Neuron Konrad}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two
% commands used to separate the names and addresses of multiple
% authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.

\begin{abstract}
We consider the problem of describing neurons in single neuron images.  To do this we map the problem to a problem of constructing a lineage to one %Results for published benchmark sequences demonstrate the superiority of this approach.
%
%We consider the problem of multicut tracking and attack if with various sophisticated optimization algorithms appleid to trucated models with the goal of admitting effienct inference.  
%We apply Benders decomposition in conjunction with column generation in order to tackle the problem of multi-object tracking and instance segmentation concurrently. In this case a track of an object corresponds to a subset of the detections present across time.  We employ the multi-cut formulation of tracking+instance segmentation.  In our case columns correspond to subsets of the detections at a given time.    This lies in contrast to the clear use of column generation where a column describes a complete track including all of its detections across time.  Benders decomposition is used to include inter-termporal interactions.  Our formulation is applied to the multi-cut formulation and can be shown to correspond to a tighter LP relaxation.

\section{Formulation}
\subsection{Tracks }

\begin{itemize}
\item
We describe the set of detections as $\mathcal{D}$ which we index with $d$.  
\item 
We describe the set of tracks as $\mathcal{P}$ which we index with $p$.  
\item 
We use $X \in \{0,1\}^{|\mathcal{D}\times \mathcal{P}|}$ to denote a mapping of detections to tracks where $X_{dp}=1$ indicates that track $d$ is associated with track $p$.  
\item 
A track consists of as sequence of sub-tracks each of $k$ detections where $k$ is a user defined hyper-parameter that trades off model complexity and efficiency of inference. 
\item 
 We use $\bar{X} \in \{0,1\}^{|\mathcal{D}\times \mathcal{P}|}$ to denote a mapping of detections to tracks where $X_{dp}=1$ indicates that track $d$ is associated with track $p$ and detection $d$ is not in the first $k-1$ detections  on the track.  .
 \end{itemize}
 \subsection{Sub-Tracks }
   \begin{itemize}
\item 
We define the set of subtracks as $\mathcal{S}$ which we index with $s$.  A given subtrack has elements $\{s_1,s_2,s_3...s_k\}$ ordered in time from earliest to latest.  
\item
We use $F \in \{ 0,1\}^{|\mathcal{D}| \times |\mathcal{S}|}$ which we index by $d,s$ respectively.   We set $F_{ds}=1$ if and only if detection $d$ is in subtrack $s $.  
\item
We use $F^- \in \{ 0,1\}^{|\mathcal{D}| \times |\mathcal{S}|}$ which we index by $d,s$ respectively.   We set $F_{ds}=1$ if and only if detection $d$ is the final detection on subtrack $s$.  
\item 
We define a mapping of tracks to subtracks using a matrix $S^0 \in \{0,1 \}^{|\mathcal{S}|\times |\mathcal{P}|}$.  We use $S^0_{sp}=1$ to indicate that track $p$ contains subtrack $s$ as neither the start nor the end.  
\item 
In order to describe the first subtrack on a  track we use matrix $S^+ \in \{0,1 \}^{|\mathcal{S}|\times |\mathcal{P}|}$ which we index with $s,p$ where $S^+_{sp}=1$ if and only if subtrack $s$ is the first subtrack on track $p$
\item 
In order to describe the first subtrack on a  track we use matrix $S^- \in \{0,1 \}^{|\mathcal{S}|\times |\mathcal{P}|}$ which we index with  $s,p$ where $S^+_{sp}=1$ if and only if subtrack $s$ is the first subtrack on track $p$

\item 
The subtracks in the sequence that describes a track overlap eachother.  Hence if a sub-tracks $s_1$ is succeeded by another subtrack $s_2$ on a given track then the final $k-1$ elements on $s_1$ are the same as the earliest $k-1$ elements in $s_2$
\item
We use $Q \in \{ 0,1\}^{|\mathcal{S}| \times |\mathcal{S}|}$ which we index by $s_1,s_2$ respectively.   We set $Q_{s_1s_2}=1$ if and only if subtrack $s_1$ can succeed $s_2$.  
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Costs }
We associate tracks with costs with costs usign the folowing noattion.  We use $\Theta \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{P}}$ which we index by $p$ to associate  tracks  with costs.  We use $\Theta_p$ to associate track $p$ with a cost.  
\begin{itemize}
\item We use $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{S}|,3}$ which we index by $s/ [+,-,0]$ respectively.  
\item 
We use $\theta_{s+}$ to denote the cost of starting a track at subtrack $s$.  
\item 
We use $\theta_{s-}$ to denote the cost of terminating a track at subtrack $s$. 
\item 
We use $\theta_{s0}$ to denote the cost of including  a subtrack $s$ in a track as neither the start nor the end  . 
 \end{itemize}
 
 We assocaite a track with cost with cost $\Theta_p$ as follows.  
 \begin{align}
 \Theta_p=\sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}}S^+_{sp}\theta_{s+}+S^-_{sp}\theta_{s-}+S^0_{sp}\theta_{s0}
 \end{align}
 
 \subsection{Collection of Tracks}
 
 We describe a collection of tracks that describe a neuron using a vector $\gamma \in \{ 0,1\}^{|\mathcal{P}|}$ which we index with $p$.  We set $\gamma_p=1$ if and only if track $p$ is incuded in the neuron.  
 
 We use $\Gamma$ to describe the set of all possible neurons.  This a subset of $\gamma \in \{ 0,1\}^{|\mathcal{P}|}$ The cost associated with a nueron described by $\gamma$ is defined by the sum of the tracks that compose it.  The selection of the lowest cost neuron is thuse written below   
 
 \begin{align}
 \min_{\gamma \in \Gamma}\sum_p \gamma_p\Theta_p
 \end{align}
 
 \subsection{Feasibility}

We assume that the soma is defined by a subtrack $s_0$ which is a special subtrack that initializes the neuron.  
 
 A track is included or not included :  $\gamma_p \in \{0,1\}$
 
 No two tracks can continue through a given detection
 \begin{align}
 \sum_p \gamma_p\hat{X}_{dp}\leq 1 \quad \forall d
 \end{align}
 
 A detetion can not be part of more than two tracks.  This blocks succession in close proximity.  
  \begin{align}
 \sum_p \gamma_p X_{dp}\leq 2 \quad \forall d
 \end{align}
%
 A track can not split off a subtrack unless that sub-track is already on a track
 \begin{align}
 \sum_p S^+_{sp}\gamma_p \leq \sum_p S^0_{sp}\gamma_p \quad \forall s \neq s_0
 \end{align}
